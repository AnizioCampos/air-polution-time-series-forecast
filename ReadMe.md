# Air Quality Forecasting Project

This project focuses on forecasting air quality using historical air quality data. It employs several preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and machine learning models to predict future concentrations of air pollutants.

## Overview

The repository contains Python scripts for preprocessing air quality data, extracting features, and building forecasting models. The main objective is to predict carbon monoxide levels based on historical data.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time series analysis
- Feature engineering, including lag features and rolling window statistics
- Machine learning models for forecasting
- Visualization of time series data and forecasting results

## Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- xgboost
- streamlit
- feature_engine

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost streamlit feature_engine
